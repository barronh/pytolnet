pytolnet Examples
=================

The list of examples will grow, but currently includes a plotting script. The plotting script retrieves data and reports a statistical description.

The examples assume that you have installed pytolnet:

.. code-block::

    python -m pip install git+https://github.com/barronh/pytolnet.git


After that, you can copy or download the example code to run it.
